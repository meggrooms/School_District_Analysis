Analysis
The written analysis has the following:

Overview of the school district analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is well defined (3 pt).
Results:

There is a bulleted list that addresses how each of the seven school district metrics was affected by the changes in the data (10 pt).
Summary:

There is a statement summarizing four changes to the school district analysis after reading and math scores have been replaced (5 pt).


# School District Analysis
Standardized Test Analysis, the Correlation Between Test Scores and Budget, and Calculating for Academic Integrity


----------------
## Purpose
Initially my job was to rank 15 Colorado high schools based on student performance based on a variety of factors, including test scores, school size, type of school, & per capita budget. This portion of the project focused primarily on cleaning data and performing calculations but there were some errors in the data. A subset of students were assigned incorrect prefix and suffix designations, important data was missing, and column organization wasn't intuitive. I was tasked with cleaning and presenting the data.

### Topics Covered
• Jupyter Notebook <br>
• Read an external CSV file<br>
• Format a DataFrame column<br>
• Determine data types of row values<br>
• Retrieve data from specific columns<br>
• Merge, filter, slice, and sort<br>
• Apply the groupby() function<br>
• Use multiple methods to perform a function<br>
• Perform mathematical calculations on columns<br>

### How School Distrist Metrics Changed
 • The original metric for the school district summary shows nominally elevated passing scores as compared to the adjusted summary that reflects the exclusion of the incorrect 9th grade scores.
