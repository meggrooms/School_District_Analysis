# School District Analysis
Standardized Test Analysis, the Correlation Between Test Scores and Budget, and Calculating for Academic Integrity


----------------
## Purpose
Initially my job was to rank 15 Colorado high schools based on student performance based on a variety of factors, including test scores, school size, type of school, & per capita budget. This portion of the project focused primarily on cleaning data and performing calculations but there were some errors in the data. A subset of students were assigned incorrect prefix and suffix designations, important data was missing, and column organization wasn't intuitive. I was tasked with cleaning and presenting the data.
